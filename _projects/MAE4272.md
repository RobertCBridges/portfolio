## Project Overview
As part of MAE 4272, our team designed and tested a small wind turbine blade for use in Cornell’s Big Blue wind tunnel. The goal of the project was to increase mechanical power output at a target operating speed of 500 RPM and a representative wind speed of 6.23 m/s, while maintaining structural safety and ensuring the blade could be manufactured with the available processes. The work combined aerodynamic design, structural assessment, and experimental testing, with analysis and data interpretation performed using MATLAB, ANSYS, and CAD-based design tools.

## Design Process
The NACA 4418 airfoil was selected for its favorable low-Reynolds-number lift-to-drag performance and ease of manufacturing at small scale. Using a target operating speed of 500 RPM and a representative wind speed of 6.23 m/s, we iteratively developed the blade’s spanwise chord and pitch distributions to maintain an efficient angle of attack while satisfying geometric and structural constraints. Several candidate pitch distributions were evaluated before converging on a nonlinear taper that balanced aerodynamic performance with structural margin and manufacturability.

## Testing Summary
The blade was experimentally evaluated in the Big Blue wind tunnel across a range of operating conditions, with mechanical power computed from measured rotational speed and applied load. The resulting power curves exhibited the expected monotonic increase with RPM and wind speed, validating overall aerodynamic trends predicted by analysis. However, operation near peak power was limited by the onset of significant vibration, suggesting resonance effects not fully captured in the initial modeling and motivating further dynamic analysis.

## My Contribution
I contributed primarily to the analysis and interpretation aspects of the project, supporting the MATLAB-based workflow used to evaluate aerodynamic and structural performance and to compare predicted trends against experimental results. I also assisted in diagnosing vibration-limited behavior near peak power and in identifying targeted design refinements to improve stability and expand the safe operating envelope.

  <strong>Next improvements:</strong> correct pitch sign convention and re-optimize pitch distribution, refine CAD geometry/manufacturing tolerances, and perform a resonance/vibration assessment to enable stable testing closer to peak power.

For this project, we aimed to design, analyze, manufacture, and test a wind turbine blade capable of maximizing power output in the Big Blue wind tunnel while making sure to remain structurally safe and manufacturable. Using a target of 500 RPM and a representative wind speed of 6.23 m/s, we developed a 6-inch blade based on the NACA 4418 airfoil and then evaluated its aerodynamics and structural performances through a MATLAB model, ANSYS simulation, and wind tunnel testing. Our simulations confirmed smooth pressure distributions and stresses far below the resin’s flexural limit, indicating a substantial safety margin for its structural stability. Experimental testing produced consistently rising power curves across multiple wind speeds, even though the occurrence of severe vibrations had limited operations near peak power, and we suspect resonance occurred. Overall, our design satisfied all geometric and structural constraints, behaved as predicted, and provided a clear direction for future improvements in pitch distribution, CAD refinement, and vibration resistance.

We began by selecting an airfoil and operating conditions, choosing a target speed of 500 RPM based on prior lab results where multiple airfoils consistently peaked in power near this value. The NACA 4418 airfoil was selected for its favorable lift to drag performance at low Reynolds numbers and ease of manufacturing. Using these conditions, we mathematically designed the blade to maintain an ideal angle of attack along its span, but an error in wind direction and rotation sign caused the pitch to be overestimated, resulting in a nonzero pitch at the tip; this would be corrected in a future iteration. Aside from this issue, the blade design approach was sound, and a nonlinear taper proportional to the inverse of the radial distance was chosen to maintain structural integrity and promote smooth force and torque distribution along the blade.

In this group, I was tasked with producing the MATLab code which tested the structual stability of our desgin. 
Our analysis and testing showed that the blade operated safely and largely as predicted, with stresses, pressures, and torque well below material limits and no visible deformation during experiments. Power measurements confirmed the expected nonlinear increase with RPM and consistent behavior across wind speeds, but vibration issues caused by an overly steep pitch prevented safe operation at higher speeds and limited our ability to capture a complete power curve. Aerodynamic performance aligned well with simulations, validating our assumptions, though low Reynolds number effects, pitch errors, CAD translation challenges, and vibration concerns constrained optimization. If the project were repeated, improvements would focus on correcting pitch calculations, smoothing blade geometry, adjusting camber and twist to shift optimal operation to higher RPM, and performing a full vibrational analysis to enable safe testing across the full operating range.

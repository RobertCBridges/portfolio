## Class overview essay
Throughout this course, engineering ethics shifted from something that felt abstract and theoretical to something deeply practical and personal. Repeatedly returning to the Boeing 737 MAX case made it clear that ethical decisions in engineering are not isolated moments but are embedded in everyday technical, organizational, and professional choices. The course emphasized that engineering is never just about making something work, but about understanding who may be affected when it does not.

One of the most important ideas I took away from this class is the responsibility engineers have to hold the safety, health, and welfare of the public above all else. This principle, which appears first in the ASME Fundamental Canons, framed nearly every discussion we had. In the case of the 737 MAX, this responsibility was compromised when Boeing prioritized market competition and cost savings over a safer redesign of the aircraft. Learning about the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System and how it relied on a single sensor was especially striking, because it showed how a seemingly small technical decision could have life-or-death consequences.

As the course progressed, I began to see the Boeing 737 MAX not just as a design failure, but as a sociotechnical failure. The aircraft existed within a complex system of engineers, managers, regulators, pilots, and airlines. Ethical responsibility was spread across this system, yet accountability was often unclear. Engineers raised concerns that were minimized, regulators relied heavily on company self-certification, and pilots were not given complete information or training. These failures directly conflicted with the ASME canons that stress honesty, competence, and issuing truthful public statements. It became clear to me that ethical lapses often happen not because of one bad decision, but because many small compromises are allowed to accumulate.

Another major lesson from the course was the importance of transparency and communication. Engineers are trained to solve technical problems, but the 737 MAX case showed that failing to communicate risks can be just as dangerous as making a flawed design. Pilots were unaware of MCAS and unprepared to respond when it malfunctioned. Looking back, this stood out as a clear ethical failure that could have been prevented by prioritizing openness over convenience. As engineers, we cannot assume others will understand a system simply because it works most of the time.

The aftermath of the crashes reinforced how ethics extends beyond design and into accountability. Boeing’s initial response, which placed blame on pilots rather than acknowledging systemic flaws, stood in contrast to the professional integrity expected of engineers. One of the ASME Fundamental Canons emphasizes upholding the honor and dignity of the profession, and this moment showed how easily trust can be lost when organizations fail to take responsibility. This part of the case made me reflect on how ethical behavior is most important when mistakes occur, not just when things go as planned.

Using history as a guide was a recurring theme in the course, and the Boeing 737 MAX became a powerful historical example of why ethical analysis must be proactive rather than reactive. Many of the issues identified after the crashes could have been addressed earlier if ethical concerns were treated with the same importance as performance metrics or deadlines. This reinforced the idea that ethical analysis should be an ongoing process throughout an engineering project, not something applied only after failure.

By the end of the course, I realized that avoiding ethical problems requires both individual integrity and supportive organizational structures. Engineers must be willing to speak up, but organizations must also create environments where doing so is encouraged and protected. Regulations must be enforced independently, and engineers must remember that professional codes of ethics exist to guide difficult decisions, especially under pressure.

Looking back, this course fundamentally changed how I view engineering responsibility. The Boeing 737 MAX case demonstrated that engineering ethics is not about perfection, but about judgment, honesty, and prioritizing human life above all else. As I move forward in my engineering education and career, this case will remain a reminder that the true measure of engineering success is not innovation alone, but the trust and safety it provides to society.

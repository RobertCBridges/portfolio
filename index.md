My name is {{ site.name }}, 
I am an AeroSpace Meng student with my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I am graduating this May, so I am looking for early career opportunities.

My interest lies in propulsion and space exploration, but I am open to exploring other industries as well.

What makes me stand out from other students are my passion projects. Automatic bird feeders, timed plant feeders, and recently my laptop stopped working and I had to dismantle it to diagnose it. Ultimately it was the logic board that was fried. By doing these myself, I am able to see the project as a whole and keep in mind the bigger picture.

For my Meng project, I have started to work on a robotic bat. With the purpose of analyzing the fluid dynamics and mechanics behind how a bat drinks. Ranging from CAD, to circuits, and material selection.
